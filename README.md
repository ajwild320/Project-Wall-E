## üöÄ Features
- **AI-Powered Image Generation**: Leveraging OpenAI's DALL-E model to create images from text prompts.
- **MERN Stack Integration**
  - **Node.js** and **Express.js** for the backend.
  - **React.js** for a dynamic frontend.
  - **MongoDB** for database storage.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling the application with the most popular CSS framework.
- **Cloudinary**: Storing and managing generated images seamlessly in the cloud.

## üõ† Technologies Used

1. **MERN Stack**:
   - **Node.js**: Backend JavaScript runtime.
   - **Express.js**: Web application framework.
   - **MongoDB**: NoSQL database.
   - **React.js**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.

2. **Tailwind CSS**:
   - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

3. **OpenAI DALL-E Model**:
   - A deep learning model that generates images based on textual descriptions.

4. **Cloudinary**:

## Important Notes
- If you choose to follow the tutorial and like to make consistent commits on Github when finishing features/code sections, Be very careful and make sure you create the 'server' directory (folder) and the 'client' directory as well then commit them both from a parent folder bearing your project name. I made the mistake of just following along with the video and only commiting from 'client' at first which completely messed up my github repo because I then ran into multiple issues with adding the 'server' directory. If you run into any trouble do not hesitate to reach out to me and I will walk you through the process to fix it!

- The project walkthrough video is 2 years old (at the time I watched it) so you will need to be ready to improvise. The API calls changed greatly and the way the API sends data back to you when you call it is also very different than in the video as well. I spent almost 8 hours working my way through the API Documentation and intricacies in the current version I am using in this project versus the one Adrian (JSMastery) was using 2 years ago. 

- Be warned, the API is no longer free to experiment with either. I paid $10 for some API tokens so i could develop and experiment in this project.
